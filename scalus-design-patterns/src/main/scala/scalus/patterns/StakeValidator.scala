// This pattern allows for delegating some computations to a given staking
// script.
//
// The primary application for this is the so-called "withdraw zero trick,"
// which is most effective for validators that need to go over multiple
// inputs.
//
// With a minimal spending logic (which is executed for each UTxO), and an
// arbitrary withdrawal logic (which is executed only once), a much more
// optimized script can be implemented.

    // Helper function for implementing validation for spending UTxOs, essentially
    // delegating their requirements to the given withdrawal validator.
    //
    // In simpler terms, it says: As long as there is a reward withdrawal of the
    // given script in transaction, this UTxO can be spent.
    //
    // Allows you to validate based on both the withdrawal's redeemer (mostly
    // useful for ensuring specific endpoints are invoked), and the withdrawal
    // Lovelace count.
