# Contributing to Scalus

## Pre-requisites

- Java 11+, sbt 1.x
- Cardano `uplc` CLI tool and Nix

## Env setup with Nix

Please ensure that Nix is installed (see https://nixos.org/download/#download-nix).

Verify that your user is marked as trusted-users in /etc/nix/nix.conf.

Run :

```bash
nix develop
```

## Build

Before committing changes, make sure that the code is formatted, compiles and the tests pass:

```bash
sbt precommit
```

## Scalus Plugin Development

During compiler plugin development you want to automatically recompile the dependencies of the
plugin.

For faster development make sure that in `build.sbt`:

1. `scalacOptions` contains `-Xplugin` with the path to the plugin jar with the dummy argument.

```scala
Seq(s"-Xplugin:${jar.getAbsolutePath}", s"-Jdummy=${jar.lastModified}")
```

1. scalusPlugin project version is not manually set

This line should be commented out in scalusPlugin project settings:

```scala
version := "0.6.2-SNAPSHOT"
,
```

### Debugging Scalus Plugin during compilation

* Run sbt with the following command:

```bash
sbt -J-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005 compile
```

This makes the compiler wait for a debugger to attach on port 5005.

* Set Breakpoints in IntelliJ
* In IntelliJ, create a Remote Debug configuration (host: localhost, port: 5005) and start it.
* Once attached, resume execution to hit your breakpoints.

## Docusaurus

Run locally

```bash
cd website
yarn install
yarn run serve
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
cd website
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

## Run benchmarks

Measurement of throughput:

```bash
sbt 'bench/jmh:run -i 1 -wi 1 -f 1 -t 1 .*'
```

Where `.*` is a regexp for benchmark names.

Profiling with [async-profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler) that should be
downloaded from
[nightly builds](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/releases/tag/nightly) and unpacked
to some directory,
like `/opt/async-profiler` for Linux in the command bellow:

```bash
sbt 'bench/jmh:run -prof "async:event=cycles;=dir=target/async-reports;interval=1000000;output=flamegraph;libPath=/opt/async-profiler/lib/libasyncProfiler.so" -jvmArgsAppend "-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints" -f 1 -wi 1 -i 1 -t 1 .*'
```

On MacOS use this command in sbt shell:

```bash
bench/jmh:run -prof "async:event=itimer;dir=target/async-reports;interval=1000000;output=flamegraph;libPath=/nix/store/mr0adcvnv8pkalfbhsgm9p762rs2pyzg-async-profiler-3.0/lib/libasyncProfiler.dylib" -jvmArgsAppend "-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints"   -f 1 -wi 1 -i 1 -t 1 .*
```

Resulting interactive flame graphs will be stored in the `bench/target/async-reports` subdirectory
of the project.

For benchmarking of allocations use `event=alloc` instead of `event=cycles` option in the command
above.

## Publishing Scalus JS library to NPM

```sbt
scalusCardanoLedgerJS / prepareNpmPackag
```

This will create a `scalus-opt-bundle.js` package in the `scalus-cardano-ledger/js/src/main/npm`
directory.

Login to NPM:

```bash
npm login
```

Update the version in `scalus-cardano-ledger/js/src/main/npm/package.json` and publish it to NPM:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

## Notes on issues

### BLS12-381 signature library

If you stumbled upon such failure during `sbt precommit`:

```
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
...
# Problematic frame:
# C  [libblst.so+0x2daa1]  sqrx_mont_384+0x41
```

you can resolve it if you will locally build Java binding of `blst` native library from:

[https://github.com/supranational/blst/tree/master/bindings/java](https://github.com/supranational/blst/tree/master/bindings/java)

and place resulted JAR into Coursier's cache at

```
~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/foundation/icon/blst-java/0.3.2/blst-java-0.3.2.jar 
```

Note please that for this you will need have installed [SWIG](https://swig.org/) toolchain.

## Scala 3 Code Style

We use [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) for code formatting. Please make sure that your
code is formatted before committing. You can run `sbt scalafmtAll` to format all code in the
project.

The `.scalafmt.conf` file in the root of the repository contains the formatting settings.

We don't enforce but recommend to stick to the following Scala 3 coding conventions:

- Use `{}` for top level definitions (classes, objects, traits, enums, etc.).
- Use `{}` for function bodies that span multiple lines.
- Use indentation-based syntax for `if`, `match`, `try`, `for` constructs unless they span multiple
  lines so it's more readable with `{}`.
- Use `then` keyword in `if` expressions.
- Use `do` keyword in `while` loops.

### Example

```scala
// Top level definition with {}
object Example {
  // Function body with {}
  def exampleFunction(x: Int): Int = {
    if x > 0 then x * 2
    else
      val y = -x
      y * 2
  }

  def describe(x: Any): String = x match
    case 1 => "one"
    case "hello" => "greeting"
    case _ => "something else"
}
```
