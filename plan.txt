Overall goal: 5 kinds of transactions built in scalus, sent to yaci, valid.

How?

1) Find a minimal attachment point, to get the code into ccl libraries.
2) Assemble a transaction (doesn't need to query utxos, can probably use in-memory, should check prior work)
3) to-cbor->from-cbor
4) send to yaci

1 --> probably for each function separately
2 --> `ScalusUtxoResolver`

SendTransaction -- how? Using CCL
