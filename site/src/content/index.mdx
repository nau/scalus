**Scalus** is a development platform for building decentralized applications (DApps) on the Cardano blockchain. It provides a unified environment where developers can write both on-chain smart contracts and off-chain logic using [Scala 3](/docs/language-tour/scala3) - a modern, expressive, and type-safe functional programming language.

## Meet Scalus

- Write Cardano smart contracts in Scala 3 that compile to UPLC
- Maintain fine-grained control over generated on-chain code with [advanced optimisations](/docs/advanced)
- Build and evaluate transactions off-chain
- Integrate on-chain and off-chain components in your full-stack application
- Test your entire application with unit, integration, and property-based tests
- Debug your solution on a testnet
- Build and deploy production-ready application to mainnet


Enjoy a modern development experience with excellent IDE support, and the [extensive Scala](https://index.scala-lang.org/) & JVM ecosystems.

Say goodbye to juggling multiple languages, libraries, and toolsâ€”meet Scalus, a development platform made for professionals and businesses who want to get things done.
