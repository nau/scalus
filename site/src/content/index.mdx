# Introduction
## What is Scalus?

Scalus is a development platform that brings the power and expressiveness of Scala to the Cardano blockchain
ecosystem. It allows developers to write both on-chain smart contracts and off-chain application logic using a single
language: Scala.

Traditional Cardano development requires learning specialized languages like Aiken or Plutarch/Haskell for on-chain
code, while using another language for client applications. Scalus eliminates this complexity by providing a unified
development experience.

{/* TODO: Update the code - simple validator */}
```scala filename="welcome.scala" copy showLineNumbers
object Hello {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
        println("Hello, world")
    }
}
```

Scalus compiles annotated Scala code directly to Plutus Core (the execution language of the Cardano blockchain) while
 maintaining all the safety guarantees and expressiveness of the Scala language. This unified approach significantly
 reduces the complexity of building, testing, and deploying Cardano applications.
