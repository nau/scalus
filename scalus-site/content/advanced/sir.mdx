# Scalus Intermediate Representation (SIR)

Scalus generates an intermediate representation (SIR) of your code. SIR is a simplified, lambda calculus-based representation that closely resembles Plutus Core but is easier to work with and optimize.

SIR serves as a bridge between your high-level Scala code and the final Plutus Core output. It preserves the semantics of your program while stripping away Scala-specific constructs, making it ideal for:

- Applying optimizations before final code generation
- Analyzing and debugging the compiled script
- Understanding how your Scala code translates to on-chain logic

## Pretty-printing SIR
It's a good idea to print the SIR to understand what the compiler has generated.

```scala mdoc:compile-only copy showLineNumbers {3-4}
import scalus.*, scalus.sir.SIR
val sir: SIR = ??? // from the previous example
println(sir.show) // pretty-print the SIR
println(sir.showHighlighted) // pretty-print the SIR with colorized syntax highlighting
```

## SIR optimisations

Scalus Intermediate Representation (SIR) can be optimized. Currently,
the only optimization is the `RemoveRecursivity` optimization that inlines `let` expressions.

```scala mdoc:compile-only copy showLineNumbers {3,5}
import scalus.*, scalus.sir.*
val sir: SIR = ??? // from the previous example
val optimized = BooleanOptimizer.optimize(sir)
// or using the `|>` operator
val optimized2 = sir |> BooleanOptimizer.optimize
```
