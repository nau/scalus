# UPLC optimisations

Scalus provides optimization capabilities for Untyped Plutus Core (UPLC) scripts, which can significantly reduce script size and execution costs. 

The `EtaReduce` optimization identifies and eliminates unnecessary lambda abstractions. For example, it transforms expressions like `Î»x. f x` into just `f` when `x` is only used once as a direct argument. This simplification reduces the number of function applications during execution, making your scripts more efficient.

{/*Other available UPLC optimizations include constant folding, dead code elimination, and various term simplifications that can further improve script performance on the Cardano blockchain.*/}

```scala mdoc:compile-only copy showLineNumbers {3-6}
import scalus.uplc.Term, scalus.uplc.transform.*
val uplc: Term = ???
val opt = EtaReduce(uplc)
```
