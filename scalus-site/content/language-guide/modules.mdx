# Modules and reusable code

You can define reusable code in a Scala object annotated with `@Compile`.
Scalus will compile the code to *.sir files and include them in the jar file.
This way you can distribute your code as a library.

Use `@Ignore` to exclude a definition from the compilation.

The `compile` will link the modules together and compile them to a single script.

```scala

@Compile
object ReusableCode {
    val constant = BigInt(1)
    def usefulFunction(a: BigInt): BigInt = a + 1
    @Ignore // this function is not compiled to UPLC
    def shouldNotBeInUplc() = ???
}

val modules = compile {
    ReusableCode.usefulFunction(ReusableCode.constant)
}
```
