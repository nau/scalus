# Functions

Functions are the same as in Scala 3.

Scalus supports both recursive and non-recursive functions.

```scala mdoc:compile-only
compile {
    val nonRecursiveLambda = (a: BigInt) => a + 1

    def recursive(a: BigInt): BigInt =
        if a == BigInt(0) then 0
        else recursive(a - 1)
}
```
