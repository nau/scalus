# UPLC optimisations

Scalus provides optimization capabilities for Untyped Plutus Core (UPLC) scripts, which can significantly reduce script size and execution costs. 

The `EtaReduce` optimization identifies and eliminates unnecessary lambda abstractions. For example, it transforms expressions like `Î»x. f x` into just `f` when `x` is only used once as a direct argument. This simplification reduces the number of function applications during execution, making your scripts more efficient.

{/*Other available UPLC optimizations include constant folding, dead code elimination, and various term simplifications that can further improve script performance on the Cardano blockchain.*/}

```scala mdoc:compile-only copy showLineNumbers {3-6}
import scalus.*, scalus.sir.*
val sir: SIR = ??? // from the previous example
val optimized = RemoveRecursivity(sir)
val uplc = optimized.toUplc()
val opt = uplc |> EtaReduce.apply
```
