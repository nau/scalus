# Advanced

This section covers advanced topics in Scalus that help you optimize your on-chain code, access specific data efficiently, and understand the underlying compilation process.

Scalus provides powerful features:

- [Macros](/docs/advanced/macros) - Inlining constants and conditional code generation
- [Direct access to Script Context fields](/docs/advanced/script-context)
- [Scalus Intermediate Representation (SIR)](/docs/advanced/sir) for debugging
- [UPLC optimizations](/docs/advanced/uplc) to reduce script size and execution costs

These advanced techniques allow you to write more efficient validators that consume less memory and execution units on the Cardano blockchain.
